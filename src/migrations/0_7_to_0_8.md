# Migration from v0.7 to v0.8

Since 0.8 was released at the same day as 0.7, there are not many changes.
It is worth noting though, that the `async-trait` crate was removed in favor of regular async traits available since Rust 1.75.
This means that all manual uses of `#[async_trait]` for `AsyncComponent` or similar traits have to be removed.
